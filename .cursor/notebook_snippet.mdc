Please provide:
- The absolute bare minimum code that works
- Direct executable statements only - NO functions
- NO try-except blocks or error handling
- Descriptive variable names
- Only essential imports
- Code that runs immediately when pasted into a notebook cell

## Example of what I DON'T want:
```python
def process_data(filename):
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(filename)
        processed = df.groupby('category').mean()
        return processed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

result = process_data('data.csv')
print(result)
```

## Example of what I DO want:
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
result = df.groupby('category').mean()
result  # Jupyter will display this automatically
```

Give me just the raw code with minimal necessary comments. Remember: fewer lines is better!
